# fMRI_Classification_Analysis
Machine learning classification analysis of fMRI data to detect visual domains in the Inferior Temporal Cortex.
The classifications were done using Naive Bayes Classifiers.


PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Scientists do not yet have a strong understanding of how and when the visual cortex develops
during infancy. Using fMRI data from a longitudinal study of baby monkeys, I analyze the early
development of the visual cortex by applying machine learning classifiers to the data and
testing for classification accuracy.  This type of analysis is called Multivoxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA).
My tests revealed that the visual cortex is very responsive by the age of 3 months, but that it also continues 
to develop a great deal between ages of 3 and 9 months.
