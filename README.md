# fMRI_Classification_Analysis
A machine learning analysis of fMRI data to detect visual domains in the Inferior Temporal Cortex.


## PROJECT ABSTRACT
Scientists do not yet fully understand the development timeline of the visual cortex during infancy. In this analysis, I use machine learning techniques to explore the early development of the visual cortex in baby macaque monkeys. Specifically, I perform a multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) on fMRI data collected during a longitudinal study involving visual experiments. This analysis reveals that the visual cortex is highly responsive by the age of 3 months and undergoes rapid development between the ages of 3 and 9 months.
