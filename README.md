# fMRI_Classification_Analysis
Machine learning classification analysis of fMRI data to detect visual domains in the Inferior Temporal Cortex


PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Scientists do not yet have a strong understanding of how and when the visual cortex develops
during infancy. Using data from a longitudinal study of baby monkeys, I analyze the early
development of the visual cortex by applying machine learning classifiers to fMRI data and
testing for classification accuracy. This analysis reveals that the visual cortex is very responsive
by the age of 3 months, but that it also continues to develop a great deal between ages of 3 and
9 months.
